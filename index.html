  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
    The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
    is an information system where documents and other web resources are
    identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/),
    which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.

  <h3> welcome to Sophie's <strong> <u>web</u> page</strong> </h3>
   This web page is the first one that I made during the coding class.
  It is little bit unusual to me but I'm so exciting to learning this ^o^.
  <br> Actually, I didn't make a dicsison How I fill this page and for what I gonna use this page yet.
  Anyway, it's cool that I know how to make a web page and I hope to keep learning this :D
